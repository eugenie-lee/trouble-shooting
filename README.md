# trouble-shooting
The purpose of this repo is to keep track of what I've learned through every trouble-shooting progress.
What I want to improve through this recording, is my mindset in dealing with troubles.
I always panicked and couldn't get the situation straight with the error occurs.
Therefore I will always remind the statements below and keep in mind when I do trouble shooting


## 나만의 trouble shooting mindset
** Mindset **
- 침착해져라
- 차분하게 마음을 가라 앉히고 섬세한 예술가가 됐다고 생각하고 코드 한줄한줄 확인해봐라
- 대응하라
