# trouble-shooting
The purpose of this repo is to keep track of what I've learned through every trouble-shooting progress.
What I want to improve through this recording, is my mindset in dealing with troubles.
I always panicked and couldn't get the situation straight with the error occurs.
Therefore I will always remind the statements below and keep in mind when I do trouble shooting
